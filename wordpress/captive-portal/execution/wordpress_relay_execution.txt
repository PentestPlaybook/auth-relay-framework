1) Prepare the Simulated Access Point

a) Power off your WiFi Pineapple.

b) Create a Kali access point using the same ESSID and passphrase as the Pineapple’s Evil WPA AP:
https://github.com/PentestPlaybook/wpa2-setup-and-hacking/blob/main/wpa2-setup.sh

c) Connect your client to the Kali AP and verify the Wi-Fi icon is displayed, confirming an active connection.

d) Select the Kali AP in your deauth tool now (before the Pineapple boots and creates an identical AP).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Boot the WiFi Pineapple and Configure Evil Portal:

a) Power on the WiFi Pineapple and navigate to Evil Portal (http://172.16.42.1:1471/#/Modules/evilportal).

b) Connect your Android device to the Pineapple's Evil WPA AP.

c) Add your Android Device's private IP to the "Allowed Clients" list in Evil Portal.

d) Toggle your Android Device's Wi-Fi off and on.

e) Verify the Wi-Fi icon is displayed, confirming an active connection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Prepare the Wordpress Relay Automation:

a) Connect your Android device to the Pineapple AP.
(Note: Ensure the Wi-Fi icon is visible and the Pineapple has internet access.)

b) Tap "START AUTO-SETUP" in WordpressRelayApp.
(Note: If the setup fails, ensure you completed the setup instructions in termux_setup.txt)

c) Enter your WordPress domain when prompted (e.g., example.com).
(The domain will be saved and pre-filled for future use.)

d) If prompted, enter your Pineapple's SSH root password.
(This is only required during initial setup - to transfer the SSH public key to the Pineapple.)

e) Wait for the automated setup to complete all 4 steps:
   - Step 1: Termux installation verification
   - Step 2: Pineapple connection test
   - Step 3: SSH key setup and script download
   - Step 4: Relay service startup

f) The app will automatically launch Termux:X11 when the browser is ready.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Execute the Client Capture:

a) Deauthenticate the Kali AP to force the client to disconnect.

b) The client should automatically connect to the Pineapple’s Evil WPA AP.

c) Upon connection, the client will be redirected to the captive portal at 172.16.42.1

d) Enter your WordPress username, password, and OTP code into the captive portal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Attack Simulation Success:

a) The Wordpress Relay App will intercept the captured credentials/OTP and automatically log in to the target WordPress account.

b) Upon successful authentication, the client will be granted full internet access through the Pineapple.
