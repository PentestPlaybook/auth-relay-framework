1) Prepare the Simulated Access Point

a) Power off your WiFi Pineapple.

b) Create a Kali access point using the same ESSID and passphrase as the Pineapple’s Evil WPA AP:

c) Connect your client to the Kali AP and verify the Wi-Fi icon is displayed, confirming an active connection.

d) Select the Kali AP in your deauth tool now (before the Pineapple boots and creates an identical AP).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Boot the WiFi Pineapple and Configure Evil Portal:

a) Power on the WiFi Pineapple and navigate to Evil Portal (http://172.16.42.1:1471/#/Modules/evilportal).

b) Connect your Android device to the Pineapple's Evil WPA AP.

c) Add your Android Device's private IP to the "Allowed Clients" list in Evil Portal.

d) Toggle your Android Device's Wi-Fi off and on.

e) Verify the Wi-Fi icon is displayed, confirming an active connection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Prepare the Wordpress Relay Automation:

a) Tap Button 1 in WordpressRelayApp to verify Termux is set up.
(Note: If button 1 fails, ensure you completed the setup instructions in termux_setup.txt)

b) Connect your Android device to the Pineapple AP.
(Note: Ensure the Wi-Fi icon is visible and the Pineapple has internet access.)

c) Tap Button 2 in WordpressRelayApp to verify your Android Device is connected to your pineapple.

d) Tap Button 3 in WordpressRelayApp to download wordpress-relay.py and establish SSH access to the Pineapple.
(Note: Your Pineapple SSH Password is required for the initial setup) 

e) Tap Button 4 in WordpressRelayApp and enter your Wordpress domain. Wait for the browser to open and connect to your WordPress site.
(Note: If Button 4 fails, make sure your WordPress Droplet allows inbound traffic on port 443.)

Troubleshooting: 
1) If a button fails on the first attempt, tap it again.
2) If you just booted your Android device, wait a moment for all services/drivers to finish loading.
3) If Button 4 fails repeatedly, restart your Android device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Execute the Client Capture:

a) Deauthenticate the Kali AP to force the client to disconnect.

b) The client should automatically connect to the Pineapple’s Evil WPA AP.

c) Upon connection, the client will be redirected to the captive portal at 172.16.42.1

d) Enter your WordPress username, password, and OTP code into the captive portal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Attack Simulation Success:

a) The Wordpress Relay App will intercept the captured credentials/OTP and automatically log in to the target WordPress account.

b) Upon successful authentication, the client will be granted full internet access through the Pineapple.
