1) Connect Devices and Select Target AP:

a) Create a Kali access point using this script:
https://github.com/PentestPlaybook/wpa2-setup-and-hacking/blob/main/wpa2-setup.sh

b) Connect your client to the Kali AP and verify the Wi-Fi icon is displayed, confirming an active connection.

c) Connect your android to the Pineapple's Management Access Point and verify the Wi-Fi icon is displayed, confirming an active connection.

d) Discover and select the Kali AP in your deauth tool.

2) Prepare the Wordpress Relay Automation:

a) Tap "START AUTO-SETUP" in WordpressRelayApp.
(Note: If the setup fails, ensure you completed the setup instructions in termux_setup.txt)

b) Enter your WordPress domain when prompted (e.g., example.com).
(The domain will be saved and pre-filled for future use.)

c) If prompted, enter your Pineapple's SSH root password.
(This is only required during initial setup - to transfer the SSH public key to the Pineapple.)

d) Enter your target's SSID and passphrase when prompted.

e) Wait for the automated setup to complete all 5 steps:
   - Step 1: Termux installation verification
   - Step 2: Pineapple connection test
   - Step 3: SSH key setup and script download
   - Step 4: Evil Twin (Network Clone)
   - Step 5: Relay service startup

f) The app will automatically launch Termux:X11 when the browser is ready.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Execute the Client Capture:

a) Turn on your client's screen and ensure it is still connected to the Kali AP.

b) Deauthenticate the Kali AP to force the client to disconnect.

c) The client should automatically connect to the Pineapple’s Evil WPA AP.

d) Upon connection, the client will be redirected to the captive portal at 172.16.42.1

e) On the client, enter your WordPress username, password, and OTP code into the captive portal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Attack Simulation Success:

a) The Wordpress Relay App will intercept the captured credentials/OTP and automatically log in to the target WordPress account.

b) Upon successful authentication, the client will be granted full internet access through the Pineapple.
