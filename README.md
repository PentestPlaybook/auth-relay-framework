# Auth Relay Framework

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Responsible Use Only

This repository contains security research tools intended **exclusively** for authorized penetration testing, security research, and educational purposes.

### üéØ Intended Use Cases

- **Authorized Penetration Testing**: Only use with explicit written permission from system owners
- **Security Research**: Educational analysis of authentication mechanisms
- **Red Team Exercises**: Internal security assessments with proper authorization
- **Academic Research**: Understanding authentication bypass techniques for defensive purposes

### üö® Legal and Ethical Requirements

**BEFORE USING THESE TOOLS:**

1. **Obtain Written Authorization**: Never use without explicit permission from network/system owners
2. **Follow Local Laws**: Ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
3. **Respect Scope Limits**: Only test systems you are authorized to test
4. **Document Properly**: Maintain clear records of authorized testing activities
5. **Report Responsibly**: Follow coordinated disclosure practices for any vulnerabilities found

### üõ°Ô∏è Responsible Disclosure

If you discover vulnerabilities using these tools:
- Contact the affected organization privately first
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- Follow industry-standard responsible disclosure timelines
- Consider using established bug bounty programs when available

### üìö Educational Purpose

This code is shared to help security professionals understand:
- How authentication bypass techniques work
- Methods for testing MFA implementations
- Common captive portal vulnerabilities
- Defensive measures organizations should implement

### ‚ùå Prohibited Uses

**DO NOT USE** these tools for:
- Unauthorized access to systems or networks
- Bypassing security measures without permission
- Any illegal activities
- Causing harm or disruption to services
- Commercial exploitation without proper licensing

### üîí Security Recommendations for Organizations

To protect against these techniques:
- Implement proper certificate validation
- Use HSTS and certificate pinning
- Deploy network segmentation
- Monitor for suspicious authentication patterns
- Regularly audit captive portal implementations
- Train users to recognize social engineering attempts

### üìû Contact
